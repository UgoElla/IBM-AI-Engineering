In our case, the target will be the digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the observations are the intensity and relative position of the pixels. After some training, it is possible to generate a \"function\" that map inputs (digit image) to desired outputs(type of digit). The only problem is how well this map operation occurs.
